# YouTube Video Question Answering System

This project presents a YouTube-based question answering system developed using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system allows users to input the URL of a YouTube video and ask questions about its content. It leverages language models and semantic search to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses by analyzing the video transcript. The implementation utilizes the LangChain framework and OpenAIâ€™s language and embedding models to integrate various NLP components into a cohesive pipeline.

## Project Objectives
The core objectives of the project are:

  To facilitate automated understanding of YouTube video content through transcript processing.
  
  To enable users to interact with video content using natural language queries.
  
  To demonstrate the integration of transcript extraction, vector-based semantic search, and large language models for intelligent response generation.
  
  To ensure that generated responses are grounded strictly in the factual information contained in the video.
